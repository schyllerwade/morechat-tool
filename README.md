# MoreChat.ai - Never Lose Context in AI Conversations

## Overview

MoreChat.ai is a web-based tool that intelligently compresses long AI conversations into concise handoff summaries. Perfect for when you hit message limits or want to switch between different AI platforms.

## The Problem

- AI chatbots cut you off after 100-200 messages
- Switching from ChatGPT to Claude means losing all context
- Manually summarizing 10,000+ words is time-consuming and error-prone

## The Solution

Paste your conversation, click compress, get an intelligent summary that preserves all key decisions, facts, and context while reducing size by 50-85%.

## Features

- 🧠 **Smart AI Compression** - Keeps what matters, removes chitchat
- ⚡ **10 Second Process** - Faster than reading the conversation yourself
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - Your conversations are never stored
- 🎯 **Context Preserved** - Key decisions and technical specs maintained
- 🔄 **Works With All AIs** - ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.
- 💰 **Free to Use** - Bring your own API key for unlimited compressions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier)
- **Cost**: ~$0.001 per compression

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Deploy to Vercel (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. Buy morechat.ai domain
4. Launch! (see LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md)

## How It Works

1. **User pastes conversation** - Copy entire chat from any AI chatbot
2. **AI analyzes content** - GPT-4o-mini extracts key information
3. **Smart compression** - Reduces by 50-85% while keeping context
4. **User copies summary** - Paste into new AI chat and continue

## Pricing Model (MVP)

**Free with your API key:**
- Users provide their own OpenAI API key
- Unlimited compressions
- Cost: ~$0.001 per compression (paid to OpenAI)

**Future paid option:**
- $0.10 per compression (we handle API)
- OR $5/month unlimited

## Validation Goals (Week 1)
